% EX#1:     The calculation of the area and the circumference of the circle. 
 
% assume that r = 4
 r = 4
 A = pi * r^2
 C = 2 * pi * r
  
  
  
% EX#2:      Simple calculations in Matlab

a = 4;b = 17.2;

c = 5*a
d = nthroot((b + 9.8) , 3)   % or  (b + 9.8)^(1/3)
e = 10 * sqrt(5*a + 16)    % or   10 * (5*a + 16)^(1/2)
